# Biclustering of Expression data - (Cheng & Church paper 2000)

This repository contains the implementation of the CC algorithm, one of the most classical algorithms that first introduced biclustering of Expression data.

To run the algorithm please make sure to have [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
Then, follow the instructions

1- install the dependecies

```
$ poetry install
```

2 - Run the main file with the following command

```
$ poetry run python main.py
```

This will return an execution of the algorithm according to the specifications on the main file.
